### The personal website of albychen5.

Recently updated to use some of the things I've learned about jQuery and Bootstrap. Should also be mobile friendly at this point.

Things that I've learned: Font Awesome is legit *awesome*, China isn't very happy with Google APIs, CDNs, or any of the like, and once you go to the same coffee shop for a week straight, order medium iced americanos and sit there for an entire day the coffee shop owner will consider you a regular, even if you hog a table for the whole day.
